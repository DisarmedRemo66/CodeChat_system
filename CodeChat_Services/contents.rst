CodeChat services
*****************
"The Apache Thrift software framework, for scalable cross-language services development, combines a software stack with a code generation engine to build services that work efficiently and seamlessly between C++, Java, Python, PHP, Ruby, Erlang, Perl, Haskell, C#, Cocoa, JavaScript, Node.js, Smalltalk, OCaml and Delphi and other languages." [#]_

A Thrift file defines CodeChat services, which are then provided by the `../CodeChat_Server/contents` CodeChat server and used by the `../CodeChat_Server/CodeChat_Server/CodeChat_Client/contents` and by text editor/IDE plugins such as `../VSCode_Extension/contents`.
